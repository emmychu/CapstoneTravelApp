## Important Notes
The application accepts city, state(if located within US) and country. If not found the background image will show a random image for the country instead of the city. There is an option to display a calendar which shows the start and end date of the trip. Start is represented by the color green and end is represented by the color red. The calendar also displays the forecast 16 days in advance.
